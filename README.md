# Personal Website Repo
I built my personal website as an exercise to use Next.JS and Tailwind CSS.  I figured that it would be beneficial to anyone looking at my site to be able to view the source code before it was built.  Hence this repo.  Enjoy and if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me!
